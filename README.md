# 👋 Hi, I'm Alexey!

I'm a Python enthusiast, AI tinkerer, and proud student of **Zerocoder University (Russia)**.

## 🤖 What I Do

I build projects that connect Python to the minds of modern AI models and services:

- 🧠 **ChatGPT**, **GigaChat**, **YandexGPT**
- 🎨 **Pixabay API** (for image generation and creativity)
- 🤖 **Telegram bots** (because automation is life)

Most of my work is hands-on experimentation — making large language models talk, create, and occasionally hallucinate on command.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- `Python 3.x`
- `Requests`, `FastAPI`, `MoviePy`, `Pillow`
- Integration with AI APIs and external services

## 💡 Current Focus

- Making AI more accessible through code
- Playing with prompts, automation, and multimodal magic
- Trying not to break things too often 🧪

## ☕ Fun Fact

Most of my debugging sessions are powered by caffeine and stubborn optimism.
